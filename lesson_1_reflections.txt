How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  I couldn't see the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    That means, i will never lose my code which make me more efficient.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
       Pros:You can save regularly as you want.
	   Cons:You may forget not to save but google docs will automatically save it for you

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some files are related and therefore need to be saved together in a commit, other files are saved separately which will make editing difficult for the web developer
	with his front end files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  git log: by typing it as a command line into git bash
  git diff: by typing it as a command line into git bash as follows:
  git diff first-id second-id 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I would make changes confidently without worrying because i will always come back to previous commit.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
